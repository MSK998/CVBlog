      CVBlog is a web system designed to create and share an individuals' CV
      digitally, making CV sharing a one click process.<br /><br />
      Instead of sharing a document that may have incompatibilities with an
      employers current system a web URL is all that is required to share a CV,
      this makes the overall interview process more streamlined and safer for
      the employer as they no longer need to download a potentially harmful or
      malicious document.<br /><br />
      The design of this site was handles by a pre-build library called Angular
      Material which is licensed under a permissive MIT license.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire project was built using a MEAN stack.
